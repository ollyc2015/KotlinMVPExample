# KotlinMVPExample
This is the same project as `ModelViewPresenter_ListView` found in my repo.

As Java is a language I am more familiar with, I have found it useful to look at small Kotlin projects to get used to the syntax. 

To help others, I thought I would take one of my small Java projects that I made to understand MVP and dependency injection and make a Kotlin equivalent.

Feel free to fork both this project and `ModelViewPresenter_ListView` (Java version) and look at the code to see the key differences. 

This is not meant to be perfect code, more of a learning aid to get familiar with the syntax. Butterknife has been removed from this project as view injection is handled as standard within the Kotlin programming language!
